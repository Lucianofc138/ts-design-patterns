# Typescript design patterns

Playground to learn and practice design patterns with typescript.

## What's a design pattern

A design pattern is the re-usable form of a solution to a design problem. They are specifically made for OOP and since
they are part of the solution design, they don't need code to be explained, instead they are usually described through
some kind of classes diagram, as it could be a UML diagram.

## Types of design patterns

* **Creational**: their main purpose is to create classes or objects, which are the 2 subcategories that usually organize
this design pattern (Class-creational and object-creational). Examples: [*Factory*](##factory)
* **Structural**: these patterns organize classes and object in order to achieve bigger structures and get new 
functionalities.
* **Behavioral**: these abstract different patterns of communication between objects.

## Creational patterns
### Factory

This pattern encapsulates the creation of an object inside a class (Factory). The objects can be an instance of 
different kinds of classes, but these classes always have to follow the same interface (Product).

**Examples**:
1. **Mario Bros. enemy factory**: this example is based on a [video from BettaTech](https://youtu.be/lLvYAzXO7Ek).
